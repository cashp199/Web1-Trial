7.2.3. Navigation Keys<br>
If the navigation function is provided as an on-screen gesture-based action:
● [C-6-1] WindowInsets#getMandatorySystemGestureInsets() MUST only be
used to report the Home gesture recognition area.
<p>● [C-6-2] Gestures that start within an exclusion rect as provided by the foreground
application via View#setSystemGestureExclusionRects() , but outside of
WindowInsets#getMandatorySystemGestureInsets() , MUST NOT be
intercepted for the navigation function as long as the exclusion rect is allowed
within the max exclusion limit as specified in the documentation for
View#setSystemGestureExclusionRects() .</p>
<p>● [C-6-3] MUST send foreground apps a MotionEvent.ACTION_CANCEL event once
touches start being intercepted for a system gesture, if they were previously sent
an MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN event.</p>
● [C-6-4] MUST provide a user affordance to switch to an on-screen button-based
navigation (for example, in Settings)
